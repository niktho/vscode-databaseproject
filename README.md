# SQL Server Database Deveopment template

Welcome!

This development container is an MIT-licensed open source-project, originated from trying out new concepts to simplify the day-to-day SQL Server development process. 

It utilizes the remote development concept for Visual Studio Code and brings in [FlyWay](https://flywaydb.org/) to handle database migrations.  

However, this template are still under development so use it "**as is**". Feel free to provide feedback, report issues or contribute with a pull request if there is something that can be done in a better way.  

## System Requirements
- Visual Studio Code with the Remote Containers extension installed
- Docker for Desktop

**Please** read the article [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) if this is your first time working with VS Code remote development. This will give you an introduction to the concepts and how to get started. 

## Getting Started

This section will be updated. In the meantime have a look at the blog post [Database migrations using FlyWay](https://nikolaithomassen.com/2019/08/10/database-migrations-using-flyway/)
